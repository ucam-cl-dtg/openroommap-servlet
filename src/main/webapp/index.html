<h1>OpenRoomMap</h1>

<p>We want to collect a detailed indoor plan of the Computer
Laboratory and we think that this information is best entered and kept
up to date by building users themselves.  Please use the link below to
launch our editor software which you can use to position furniture and
appliances within the building.</p>

<p>We are interested in as much detail as you are prepared to provide:
the names of the floorboxes in your office, the location of air vents,
the name of your workstation and the position of your desk and
shelving.</p>

<p align="center"><a href="applet2.html"><b>Launch open room
      map [in current window]</b></a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;or&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="javascript:load();">[in
      new window]</a></p>

<h2>Motivation</h2>

<h3>Pedestrian navigation research</h3>

<p>This work uses inertial sensors (accelerometers and gyroscopes) to
estimate the position of people within a building.  The system
combines updates from these sensors with a map of the building in
order to constrain the location estimates and derive an accurate
location. Problems remain with this technique in particular with
movement in large rooms or for repeated small movements (such as when
sat at a desk or giving a presentation).  We are interested in whether
constraints provided by information about the position of furniture
within the building can help mitigate this problem.</p>

<h3>Explaining energy consumption</h3>

<p>The William Gates Building consumes a maximum of around 300kW
during a busy weekday.  Around 200kW of this is base-load which
building consumption never drops below regardless of building usage,
whether its a weekend, or the week after Christmas.  We are interested
in how to explain this consumption. One means to explain a building's
electricity consumption is to do sub-metering and we could go as far
as installing meters on every light and every desktop.  However, this
is expensive and the energy consumption of the metering itself needs
to be considered too. We think that actually the majority of the
energy consumers within the building are static (or predictable) and
so we want to see if we can construct an explanation for the
building's consumption based on an accurate inventory.</p>

<h3>Building services</h3>

<p>It is relatively straightforward to find out the name of a
workstation or server that has failed.  A (manual) entry in the
machine database can then be consulted to work out which room the
machine is in.  However, for large offices or teaching rooms this
still leaves an element of manual searching required.  An alternative
is to consult the internal wiring database for this building, coupled
with information from switches, and work out which floorbox the
machine is attached to.  For this to be effective we need to know
where the floorboxes are. There are numerous other aspects of building
use which would be useful to collect in future.  Examples include the
occupant's perception of the building temperature, lighting levels,
mobile phone coverage, wireless network coverage.</p>

<h2>Long-term research goal</h2>

<p>The <a href="http://openstreetmap.org/">OpenStreetMap</a> project is a
highly successful initiative which is building a free, open map of the
world.  The map is constructed by volunteers who hand edit and
annotate GPS traces of their journeys.  We are seeing whether it is
possible to build similar infrastructure for maintaining maps and
plans of the interior of buildings.  For large organisations this data
would be useful for measuring inventories; keeping databases of office
occupants, phone numbers and room use updated; for explaining energy
consumption and targetting reductions; and for generating maps for
visitors and meetings.</p>

<p>The application we have written for this study is a first step
towards understanding this problem.  We hope to get some insight and
feedback from users of the William Gates Building to help us improve it.</p>

<p>Other research issues which we forsee include
<ul>
<li>Entering data for the internals of a building is a different
operation to external mapping.  In particular it is a constraint based
problem.  If you move a wall when updating a building plan this has an
impact on all the rooms which share that wall and the contents of
those rooms.  Similarly, when placing objects within a room, users are
more likely to give relative positions such as the desk is in the
corner, the shelves are above the desk etc.</li>
<li>How to deal with privacy, confidentiality or security of detailed
internal data.  Possible approaches might be a distributed database of
room contents which automatically contribute to centralised aggregate totals.</li>
<li>What incentives are needed for users to make data updates.
Projects such as OpenStreetMap seem to attract contributors through no
direct incentive but maybe indirect community effects are playing a
part.</li>
<li>How to distribute updates and manage conflicts?  The OpenStreetMap
database is a single snap-shot in time.  It doesn't describe
historical data.  However, historical information is important for
OpenRoomMap in a number of situations.  Firstly, analysing historical
electricity meter data (for example) requires the historical state of
the building.  Secondly, distributing updates to the map requires that
it must be easy to find out what has changed from a particular point
in time.</li>
